    <h1>The Benefits of Lemons</h1>
    <p>Lemons are a popular fruit that people use in small quantities to add flavor to food. However, they rarely consume them alone due to their intense, sour taste. Here are some of the benefits of lemons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rich in Vitamin C:</strong> Lemons are an excellent source of vitamin C, which is essential for a healthy immune system.</li>
        <li><strong>Improves Digestion:</strong> Drinking lemon water can help with digestion and prevent constipation.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Loss:</strong> Lemons contain pectin fiber, which can help you feel full and eat less.</li>
        <li><strong>Freshens Breath:</strong> The citric acid in lemons can help kill bacteria in the mouth, leading to fresher breath.</li>
        <li><strong>Skin Health:</strong> The antioxidants in lemons can help reduce skin damage and premature aging.</li>
    </ul>
